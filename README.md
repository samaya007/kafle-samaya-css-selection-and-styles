Class build assignment

In this DC characters project build I've made a webiste for six DC characters using HTML and CSS.

I've added a link to the DC logo which redirects (open in new tab) to the official DC website and to blend the logo background I've 
made the header background black, I've then added a grayscale background image to the the lightbox pop out, here i've mainly used verdana font and made the drop down/hover animation white so it goes along with the grayscale image, I've intensionally made the body image (rgb and b&w) unaligned so that it kinoff gives a moving animation. Here I've also changed the animation speed and added a subtly zoom in animation in the footer section and same with the Heading and sub text inside the box and I've tried keeping the whole them DC like using red black and blue and hint of green as well

Upon clicking any of the box a new image (big size character) will apper , I've aligned it to the left and aligned the text to right where i've changed the sub text colour to birght green and changed the closing ("X") icon static colour to white and red when hovered on and the main heading to white. I kept the image position at bottom and left the  background size at around 56vh since all the images used where of different shape. To make the text redable I added some light gray background and I also aligned the lightbox main text to center
